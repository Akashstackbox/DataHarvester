"Create a full-stack web application called 'Visual Warehouse Bin Utilization Map' using React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend and a Node.js backend with mock data. The app must visually represent a warehouse with the following detailed structure and features:
Warehouse Structure:
The warehouse contains multiple Areas (e.g., Area A1, Area A2, etc.).
Each Area has an Area Type: Inventory, Returns, Overflow, Staging, or Damage.
Each Area contains multiple Zones (e.g., Zone Z1, Zone Z2, etc.).
Each Zone has a Face Type: either 'Pick' (for picking items) or 'Reserve' (for storage).
Each Zone contains multiple Bins (e.g., Bin B1, Bin B2, etc.).
Bin Details:
Each Bin has a Bin Type, and multiple Bins in a Zone can share the same Bin Type or have different ones.
Bin Type includes these attributes:
Max Volume: A number representing the bin’s capacity (e.g., 1000 cubic units).
Storage HU Type: Indicates the handling unit type, either 'Pallet', 'Carton', or another type.
Bin Pallet Capacity: A positive integer (e.g., 5 pallets), only applicable if the Storage HU Type is 'Pallet'; ignored otherwise.
Each Area/Zone/Bin has a Utilization Percentage: A number from 0 to 100 representing how full it is. When we are at area level, then its area utilization; when user clicks on an area to expand to see its zone, then its zone utilization; and when user expands to see its bins, the utilization for each bin will show.
Visualization:
Display the warehouse as a hierarchical map:
Show all Areas as collapsible sections or tabs, labeled with their ID and Area Type (e.g., 'A1 - Inventory').
Inside each Area, show its Zones as groups, labeled with their ID and Face Type (e.g., 'Z1 - Pick').
Inside each Zone, show its Bins as a grid of boxes, labeled with their ID (e.g., 'B1').
Use Tailwind CSS with Flexbox for Areas and Zones, and Grid for Bins, ensuring a responsive layout.
Color-Coding for Areas/Zones/Bins for each level:
Dynamically color each Area  based on its Utilization Percentage:
0–33%: Green (low utilization).
34–66%: Yellow (medium utilization).
67–100%: Red (high utilization).
Dynamically color each Zone  based on its Utilization Percentage:
0–33%: Green (low utilization).
34–66%: Yellow (medium utilization).
67–100%: Red (high utilization).
Dynamically color each Bin based on its Utilization Percentage:
0–33%: Green (low utilization).
34–66%: Yellow (medium utilization).
67–100%: Red (high utilization).
Ensure colors are clear and distinct, with area levels, zone levels, bin labels (ID) readable against the background.
Backend Mock Data:
Provide a Node.js API route (e.g., '/api/warehouse-data') that serves mock data with this structure:
Multiple Areas, each with an ID, Area Type, and an array of Zones.
Each Zone has an ID, Face Type, and an array of Bins.
Each Bin has an ID, Bin Type (with Max Volume, Storage HU Type, and Bin Pallet Capacity where applicable), and Utilization Percentage.
Example data:
	Area A1 - Inventory (Utilization: 55%)
	 • Zone Z1 - Pick (Utilization: 30%)

APARNA’S notes:
Product Requirements Document: Warehouse Bin Utilization Visual Map System
Problem Statement
Warehouse managers and logistics professionals lack intuitive visual tools to quickly assess bin utilization across warehouse areas. Without clear visualization of space usage, inventory placement, and utilization patterns, operations teams struggle to efficiently allocate resources, identify optimization opportunities, and make data-driven decisions about warehouse space utilization. Current warehouse management systems often present this critical information in spreadsheets or text-based formats that make it difficult to spot trends, bottlenecks, or optimization opportunities at a glance.
Solution Overview
The Warehouse Bin Utilization Visual Map System will provide a color-coded, interactive visualization tool that represents warehouse areas, zones, and bins in a hierarchical structure. The system will display real-time utilization data while allowing users to filter and highlight specific data points (utilization levels, product types, SKU classes, and categories) without disrupting the overall grid layout. This approach will enable warehouse managers to quickly identify optimization opportunities, track utilization patterns over time, and make informed decisions about inventory placement.
